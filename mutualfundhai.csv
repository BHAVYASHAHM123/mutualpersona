How do I know which fund is right for me?,"When you decide to invest in Mutual Funds, you need to choose which type of fund and which Asset Management Company (AMC) to invest with.

For example: If you have a long-term goal like retirement planning and are comfortable with taking some risk, an Equity or Balanced Fund would be suitable.

To make these decisions, it's important to have an open discussion with a mutual fund distributor or investment advisor. Share your objectives, time frame, and risk appetite.

For example: If you have a short-term goal like saving money for a few months, a Liquid Fund would be appropriate.

Once you have determined the type of fund that aligns with your objectives, you need to select a specific scheme offered by an AMC. This choice is typically based on factors like the AMC's track record, suitability of the scheme, and portfolio details.

For example: If you want to generate regular income, you might consider a Monthly Income Plan or an Income Fund.

Before making any investment, it's essential to review the Scheme Factsheets and Key Information Memorandum. If you require more detailed information, you can refer to the Scheme Information Document. These documents are readily available on the websites of every Mutual Fund.

For example: By reviewing these documents, you can gain insights into the fund's performance, investment strategy, and associated risks.",which fund is right for me
ELSS Fund – Tax Saving Mutual Fund,"An Equity Linked Savings Scheme (ELSS) is a type of investment scheme that provides tax benefits to individuals or Hindu Undivided Families (HUFs). Under Section 80C of the Income Tax Act 1961, investors can deduct up to Rs. 1.5 lakhs from their total income.

Example: Let's say you earn Rs. 10 lakhs per year and you invest Rs. 50,000 in an ELSS. In this case, your taxable income would be reduced to Rs. 9.5 lakhs, resulting in a lower tax burden.

ELSS schemes have a lock-in period of three years from the date of unit allotment. Once the lock-in period is over, you have the freedom to redeem or switch your units. ELSS offers both growth and dividend options, allowing you to choose how you want to receive returns on your investment. Additionally, you can also invest in ELSS through Systematic Investment Plans (SIPs). Any investments made up to Rs. 1.5 lakhs in a financial year are eligible for tax deduction.",ELSS Fund
What is Net Asset value (NAV)?,"Net Asset Value (NAV) is a measure of the performance of a Mutual Fund scheme. It represents the market value of the securities that the scheme holds. Mutual Funds collect money from investors and invest it in securities. Since the market value of these securities changes daily, the NAV of a scheme also fluctuates accordingly. The NAV per unit is calculated by dividing the market value of securities by the total number of units of the scheme on a specific date.

Example: Imagine you invest in a Mutual Fund that holds various stocks and bonds. The NAV of the fund is like a snapshot of the total value of all those stocks and bonds. If the NAV per unit is $10, it means that for every unit you own, the securities held by the scheme are worth $10. If the NAV increases to $12 the next day, it indicates that the value of the securities held by the scheme has gone up. Similarly, if the NAV decreases to $8, it means the value of the securities has decreased. The NAV is declared at the end of the trading day when the markets are closed, as per the regulations set by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) for Mutual Funds.",NAV
Mutual Funds vs Shares: What’s the difference?,"From where do you get the vegetables for dinner? Do you grow them in your backyard, or purchase it from the nearest mandi/supermarket depending on what you need? Growing your own veggies is a great way of eating healthy food, but effort is spent on seed selection, manuring, watering, pest control, etc. The latter option allows you to choose from a wide variety without the hard work.

Similarly, you can create wealth by investing directly in shares of good companies or invest in them through Mutual Funds. Wealth can be created when we buy company stocks which use our money to grow their business, creating value for us.

Direct investment in shares carries a relatively higher risk element. You need to pick stocks by researching the company and sector. It’s a humongous task to choose few companies from thousands of them listed on the stock exchange. Once done, you need to keep a track of every stock's performance.

In Mutual Funds, the stock picking is done by expert fund managers. You need to keep track of the performance of the fund and not individual stocks within the fund. They also allow investment flexibility unlike stocks, with growth/dividend options, top-ups, systematic withdrawals/transfer, etc. besides helping to ride over volatility by investing smaller amounts regularly through SIPs.",Mutual Funds vs Shares
How to deal with rumours while investing?,"How often have you come across people you know who have lost money in the stock market because they couldn’t guess where the market would go next moment or who made money because they knew where the market was headed next? Even the best market analysts can’t predict with absolute precision how the market will move the very next moment because financial markets are driven by sentiments and market sentiments are driven by market news. 

An investor today has easy access to market news that may be factually correct or could be a rumour or mere speculation. While investment decisions based on factually correct news may yield positive results, investment decisions based on rumours or speculations can cause loss to investors. 

According to Behavioural Finance Theory, investors are irrational by nature i.e their investment behaviour is not backed by thorough research and analysis but rather influenced by various cognitive and emotional biases including herd mentality. Hence, any incorrect market information can fuel panic amongst investors leading to huge erosion of investor wealth.

Then how can an investor hold himself steady when the market is flooded with all kinds of news ranging from verified ones to rumours? This is where Mutual Fund investments can come to the rescue of millions of small investors who lack the capability and resources to carry out extensive research and analysis. Investing in mutual funds helps circumvent all the above problems as professional fund managers take care of the investment decisions on your behalf. Also, mutual fund investments held over a long period of time help you tide over short-term fluctuations caused by market volatility that is many times fueled by market rumours.

Fund managers have a team of research analysts who carry out extensive research based on all public information to evaluate each security before taking a decision to buy, hold or sell it.  You can always reach out to your SEBI registered financial advisor or mutual fund distributor for guidance in case you come across some market news regarding any security in the fund’s portfolio or about the fund that sounds worrisome.",paln everyday gole
A plan for every goal,"Yes, Mutual Funds are ideal to help you plan your life goals!

·   Mr. Rajput eventually wants to move away from the city, into a farmhouse on a hill station when he plans to retire after 15-20 years.

·   Mrs. Patel didn’t receive any retirement benefits. Although she has savings, she now needs a regular income from her investments to meet her regular expenses.

·   Mrs. Sharma has surplus money generated from her business and lets it lie idle in her bank account. She is required to pay her suppliers and staff only after a few days.

The above could be real life situations. Is there any option available for these investors?

YES!  Mutual Funds!

Mutual Funds offer different kinds of schemes for different kinds of investment objectives. For e.g.

-   Long term goals like building a corpus for retirement – You could consider equity and balanced funds

-   Looking to generate income with relatively low risk – You could consider a bond fund

-   Park your surplus money till you decide where to invest it next – You could consider a liquid fund

Mutual Funds offer different kinds of investment options for planning one’s investments, especially when one is clear about their goals.",paln everyday gole
Should goals be for the long term only or short term?,"Narendra aims to accumulate enough to make the down payment for his dream house. He started an SIP in some Mutual Fund schemes. Though he was falling a tad short, he was comfortable with what he had accrued.

He got a pleasant surprise when his company announced a big cash reward for some star employees, and he was one of them.

While the house purchase would take some time, he wasn’t sure how long. The payment may also be scheduled over a period.

What could he do with the money?

He could consider Liquid Mutual Funds as they are ideally suitable when money is required in a short period, and the time period is uncertain. It also gives the flexibility to take out even part of the money or whole of it whenever required.

So there are ample Mutual Fund schemes for both long term, and short term goals.",paln everyday gole
How can I track my investments on a regular basis?,"Investors often wonder how to go about tracking the progress of my investments.

It is like chasing a target in a cricket match. In a cricket match, the team batting second knows the equation – how many runs, how many wickets and how many overs.

It is very similar when it comes to investing for achievement of financial goal, too. Consider the financial goal as the target score-

The amount you have accumulated so far is the runs you have scored so far.
The amount yet to be accumulated is the runs to be scored and the time left is the overs left.
The condition of the wickets and the quality of the bowlers may be compared to various risks – be it related to the national or global economy; global capital flows; political situation in the country; changes in laws, regulations and taxes, etc.
The scoreboard in this case is the account statement you get when you invest in a Mutual Fund scheme.
There are also online tools, and mobile apps available to check the value of one’s investments – the scoreboard.",paln everyday gole
Are there different funds for different types of goals?,"With so many Mutual Funds schemes in the market, often one may wonder which scheme may be the best. But, understanding the meaning of “best” is more important.

Often, people tend to select the “best” performers of a recent past period – schemes that have delivered highest returns in the recent past.

If you watch a movie filmed in the USA in December, you would notice people wearing warm overalls. Someone may really like it and want to have those. However, can you imagine someone wearing woollen clothes around the streets in Mumbai or Chennai?

The same logic applies to Mutual Funds too. There is no such thing as the “best” Mutual Fund – it is always about what is appropriate in a given situation and is in line with your investment objective.

For long term goals there are different funds compared to short term needs. There are aggressive funds vastly different from moderate funds or even conservative funds. There are different funds for income generation as compared to wealth accumulation or for liquidity.

So don’t search for the best – search for the most appropriate.",paln everyday gole
Aren’t safe investments enough to meet financial goals?,"One must keep in mind that the regular expenses as well as the cost for various financial goals rise over a period. If the inflation is at 6% per year, the cost of a goal doubles over approximately 12 years. However, if the inflation is at 7%, the doubling happens roughly in ten years.

Now when inflation is at 7% and you seek total safety of the principal amount, you would be able to invest in avenues that offer returns very close to the inflation. Adjust for taxes on the investment returns and your post-tax investment returns are lower than inflation.

Let us look at some simple numbers:

If inflation is 7% per year, and you can buy something for Rs. 100 now, you would need Rs. 107 to buy the same thing next year. A year later, the same item would cost Rs. 114.49, if the inflation remains at the same level.

At the same time, if you had saved your money in a totally safe avenue that offered 6% per year after taxes, your Rs. 100 would grow to Rs. 106. This is Re. 1 less than the amount required above. After two years, the amount would have grown to Rs. 112.36, which is less than the cost of the item to be purchased. The table on the left highlights an approximate of values of investments, costs of goals and the gaps between them over a period of years.

So it’s important to not just save but invest.",paln everyday gole
"So can I invest now, for my vacation 8 months later?","Articles about Mutual Fund (MF) investments typically speak about fulfilling long-term goals. So naturally, investors assume that MFs cannot help achieving short-term goals.

Let us break this myth with the example of Ramesh, a travel junkie.

Recently, the company Ramesh worked for achieved success and rewarded its employees with bonuses. With this bonus, Ramesh wanted to plan a trip to Europe. 

However, Ramesh was working on a big and prestigious project that would take about eight months to complete. He could travel to Europe only after this project ended. So his travel dates were uncertain. 

So Ramesh decided to make use of liquid fund which are ideal for such cases where the investment period is short, but uncertain. The Funds also allow him to redeem them on any working day. The money would be credited to his account the working day after he submits a request for withdrawal, allowing for high liquidity. Certain Fund Houses also allow one to request for withdrawal through an SMS or App.

This way, he could let his money grow until he was ready to travel. He could redeem some of the funds when he finally started preparing for his trip like accommodation and flight bookings. He could use the rest of the funds during the trip to buy foreign currency and pay for daily expenses. 

Planning for short-term goals become convenient with Liquid Funds.",paln everyday gole
What are the kinds of financial goals I can fulfill with Mutual Funds?,"The best part about Mutual Funds is that no matter what your financial goal is, you can find an appropriate scheme for it.

So if you have a long term financial goal like planning for your retirement or your child’s future education than equity funds could be a choice to consider

If your endeavour is to potentially generate regular income, a fixed income fund could be considered.

You may have suddenly received a windfall of money and are yet to decide where you wish to invest, you can consider a liquid fund. A liquid fund is a good substitute to consider for a savings account or even a current account to park your working capital.

Mutual funds also offer investment options for saving tax. Equity Linked saving Schemes (ELSS) are specifically designed to do the same

Are Debt Funds suitable for my Financial Goals?,"Debt Funds provide lower but relatively stable returns as compared to equity funds. They provide stability to a portfolio as they trade in the fixed income market which is more stable in comparison to the stock market that impacts equity funds. Everyone needs a financial plan that’s designed to meet various financial goals in the future, like kid’s college education, medical expenses, house, retirement, etc. We invest our money in different assets like property, gold, stocks, Mutual Funds to achieve different financial goals that arise at different points in our lives.

Debt Funds are most suited for goals that are short-term in nature, as opposed to equity funds that are suitable for long-term goals like retirement planning, given their volatile nature in the short-term. Some Debt Funds like Liquid Mutual Funds are suitable for parking your money for few months if you’ve received a bonus or sold some other investment and are deciding on what next to do with the money. Debt funds are also suitable for goals where you don’t want to take the risk of failing to fulfil it, like the college education money that you want to withdraw in 2 years’ time. You can invest your money in a fixed income fund for such kind of goals. Thus, debt funds should be a part of every financial plan.",paln everyday gole
What happens when the market falls midway while you have invested for a longer term?,"Mutual Fund investors with long-term investments through SIPs constantly worry about market falls during this period. SIPs are well-designed to overcome some of the Mutual Fund risks like market timing and volatility.

You can beat market volatility through rupee-cost averaging, by investing regularly in Mutual Funds through SIPs. Here you buy more units when NAV is low and vice versa. The cost per unit is averaged out over the long run if NAVs move both ways. For example, if you invest INR 1,000/- per month, you get 100 units if the NAV is INR 10 and 200 units if NAV drops to INR 5. Over longertime period, the average price per unit will fall if markets move in both directions thus helping to lower volatility of returns as well.

If you invest in lump sum, number of units would remain the same during the entire holding period, but their value would go down with falling NAV during market downturns. If you hold your lumpsum investment in an equity fund for long (say over 7-8years), the occasional blips shouldn’t impact your returns as markets usually move up over the long-term. You might end up with a far higher NAV than what you started with.",Ride the market volitility
How do Mutual Funds help manage risk?,"You must properly evaluate before picking up the right Mutual Fund scheme to invest your hard-earned money. While investors often go by scheme category and top performing schemes in the category, they ignore risk indicators for these schemes. When you are comparing schemes to choose from, don’t miss out comparing their riskiness. While there are many risk indicators like Standard Deviation, Beta, and Sharpe Ratio provided in the factsheet of every scheme, product label is the most basic thing to look for. The riskometer in the label shows the risk level of the fund. This riskometer is a mandatory requirement by SEBI and represents the underlying risk associated with the fund. The six levels of risk ranging from low, low to moderate, moderate, moderately high, high, and very high have been linked to various categories of mutual funds depending on the level of risk in their portfolio. Since this kind of risk categorization has been defined by SEBI, all mutual funds are bound to categorize similar kinds of funds into the same risk category.

Apart from the riskometer which gives an overview of the fund’s riskiness, one can also look at more specific risk indicators provided in the factsheet. Standard Deviation measures the range of a fund’s return. A scheme with a higher standard deviation of return indicates its range of performance is wide, implying greater volatility. 

Beta measures a fund’s volatility with respect to the market. Beta >1 implies the scheme will be more volatile than the market and Beta<1 means it’ll be less volatile than the market. Beta of 1 indicates the scheme will move in tandem with market volatility.

Sharpe Ratio measures the excess return provided by the fund per unit of risk undertaken.  It is a good indicator of risk-adjusted return.

Why continue investing through SIPs in a volatile market?,"When the markets turn volatile many investors start doubting their investment decisions and think of stopping their SIPs or withdrawing their investments. It’s natural to get worried when you see your investments in red during a volatile market. But it would be wise to stay put with your SIPs especially during a falling market because with the same amount of monthly investments you will end up buying more units. We all love to bargain shopping be it during an online sale or simply at the sabzi shop. Isn’t it? Then why not for our Mutual Fund investments when prices are falling?

The market is more unpredictable than even our weather forecast apps. You can never time yourself perfectly to invest a lumpsum amount when the market falls. What if the market falls further after you’ve invested? Similarly, you cannot time yourself perfectly to sell at a market high because the market may go up further after you’ve sold. If you try to catch the market, you will be grossly disappointed, and your returns can be affected due to wrong timing.

If Mutual Funds diversify risk then why are they considered risky?,"Mutual Funds invest in securities, be it equity or debt, whose values fluctuate along with market movement. This makes them risky because NAV of the fund depends on the individual security values held in the fund’s portfolio. But since mutual funds invest in securities across different sectors, they diversify this market risk. Since a fund invests in many securities, the risk that all of them will go down in value on any day is reduced. Thus, it is true that mutual funds diversify risk, but they don’t eliminate it. The diversification followed by a fund manager reduces the market risk of the fund to the extent of diversification. The more diversified a fund is, the less risky it is. 

Concentrated funds like thematic or sector funds are riskier than multi-cap funds will impact all the companies of the affected sector in some way or the other while in a multi-cap fund, the diversification across sector and capitalization works like an airbag during a car accident, reducing the impact of the unfavourable condition on the fund’s NAV.

When you invest in Mutual Funds, look at the degree of diversification in the fund’s sector allocation. Depending on your risk-taking ability, choose a fund with the right kind of diversification that’ll suit you.

Why should one not be bothered by volatility in mutual funds?,"During a long drive, do you worry about your speed or the destination and how to get there? Obviously, you don’t count the bumps but focus on reaching your destination safely in time. The same goes with Mutual Funds. You shouldn’t worry about the daily NAV fluctuations but rather focus on whether it is taking you closer to the financial goal in the time you have set for it.

During the drive, there are numerous times when your speed drops to near zero, but the vehicle picks up speed once you get over the bump and continue your journey. At the end of the trip, what matters is the average speed you clocked to reach your destination. Similarly, a mutual fund can have numerous bumps in the short-term but the longer you stay invested, the impact of these fluctuations decrease and your chances of earning a positive return goes up just like your car’s average speed during a long trip. 

Every economy and hence market go through periods of growth and recession which impact your fund’s return but only in the short-term.

Does long term mean less risk?,"Investments in Mutual Funds require the appropriate time horizon. Having the right time horizon, not only provides a better chance of getting expected, investment returns, but also lowers the risk in the investment.

Now what is this “risk” we are talking about? In simple terms, it is volatility of investment performance, as well as chances of eroding investment capital. By staying invested over the long term, some years of low/negative returns and some years of impressive returns will make the average returns quite reasonable. Therefore, the investor can ‘average out every year’s widely fluctuating returns’ to get a more stable long term return.

A few major advantages of investing in debt funds are low cost structure, relatively stable returns, relatively high liquidity and reasonable safety.

Debt funds are ideal for investors who aim for regular income, but are risk-averse. Debt funds are less volatile and, hence, are less risky than equity funds. If you have been saving in traditional fixed income products like Bank Deposits, and looking for steady returns with low volatility, debt Mutual Funds could be a better option, as they help you achieve your financial goals in a more tax efficient manner and therefore earn better returns.

What are the various type of debt funds?,"Debt funds are for investors who seek safety of capital or regular income from investment and/or want to park money for short periods.

But debt funds are of various types. 

Like in banks, you can open a savings account, where you can put and remove money whenever you want.  However, it doesn’t make sense to keep money idle, if you are not likely to use it for some time. You may, in such a case, open a fixed deposit – where the money is locked for a certain period allowing you to earn a higher rate of interest. You may also opt for a recurring deposit, wherein you keep investing a fixed amount every month for a pre-defined period of time. All these products help you with different requirements.

What are Equity Funds?,"An Equity Fund is a Mutual Fund Scheme that invests predominantly in shares/stocks of companies. They are also known as Growth Funds.

Equity Funds are either Active or Passive.  In an Active Fund, a fund manager scans the market, conducts research on companies, examines performance and looks for the best stocks to invest. In a Passive Fund, the fund manager builds a portfolio that mirrors a popular market index, say Sensex or Nifty Fifty.

Furthermore, Equity Funds can also be divided as per Market Capitalisation, i.e. how much the capital market values an entire company’s equity. There can be Large Cap, Mid Cap, Small or Micro Cap Funds.

Also there can be a further classification as Diversified or Sectoral / Thematic. In the former, the scheme invests in stocks across the entire market spectrum, while in the latter it is restricted to only a particular sector or theme, say, Infotech or Infrastructure.

One would prefer that there is no drop in investment value
Even low returns should be fine, if it means the money is safe
The period may not be fixed or even known
Given the above four conditions, putting money in a fixed deposit may serve the purpose, but only to a limited extent. One of the big benefits of a fixed deposit is the safety. At the same time, one of the limitations is often ignored – the money can be parked for a fixed period only – there is no flexibility regarding the period of parking.

That is where liquid mutual funds could be considered. As is conveyed in the video too, they offer safety, reasonably good returns (in comparison to savings accounts or even very short term fixed deposits) and full flexibility of redemption any time.",Type of Mutual Funds
Are there different kinds of equity funds available?,"There are different equity funds catering to various needs of investors. The broad objective of all is to generate appreciation over long periods.

To understand it better let us look at the contingent we send to the Olympic Games. There is a large group of players, and then there are teams for various sports. One of the major events at the Olympic Games is the “track and field” event. We send a group for these events, as well. Within that, there are some races – right from a 100-meter sprint to long distance races, including marathon. Though, the whole contingent has gone to compete in the Olympic Games, there would be different players with different strengths.

It is the same with Mutual Funds. If all the Mutual Fund schemes are equivalent to the entire Olympic contingent, equity funds may be similar to a group within, which participates in, various track and field events. As we saw, there are various sub-categories even within track and field, similarly, there are different schemes within equity funds.",Type of Mutual Funds
Can one invest in multiple asset classes using one Mutual Fund scheme?,"Mutual Fund schemes investing in a single asset category are like specialist bowlers or batsmen. Whereas certain other schemes, known as hybrid funds, invest in more than one asset categories, e.g. some invest in equity and debt both. Some may also invest in gold apart from equity and debt.

In cricket, we see batting all-rounders as well as bowling all-rounders depending on the skill they are better at. Similarly, there are Mutual Fund schemes that invest heavily in one asset category as compared to another.

The oldest category, the balanced fund category, invests in equity and debt. The allocation to equity is normally higher (over 65%) and the rest is in debt.

The other popular category known as MIP or the monthly income plan endeavours to provide monthly (or regular) income to investors. However, there is no guarantee of regular income. These schemes invest predominantly in debt securities so that regular income can be generated. A small portion is invested in equity to enhance returns over the years. 

Another variation of the hybrid scheme invests in equity, debt and gold, to take advantage of three different asset classes in one portfolio.

An investor has an option of buying different equity or debt or gold fund schemes to create a hybrid portfolio or alternately buy a hybrid fund.",Type of Mutual Funds
What is a Hybrid Fund?,"Our choice of meals when we dine depend largely on the time at hand, the occasion and of course, our mood. If we’re in a hurry, say during an office lunch or eating before boarding a bus/train, we may opt for a combo meal. Or if we know a combo meal is famous, we may not bother to go through the menu. A leisurely meal would mean ordering individual items from the menu, as many as we’d like.

Similarly, an investor in a Mutual Fund can select and invest individually in various schemes, e.g. equity fund , debt fund , gold fund , liquid fund , etc. At the same time, there are schemes like a combo meal – known as hybrid schemes. These hybrid schemes, earlier known as Balanced Funds, invest in two or more asset categories so that the investor can avail the benefit of both. There are various types of hybrid funds in the Indian Mutual Fund industry. There are schemes that invest in two assets, viz., equity and debt, or debt and gold. There are also schemes that invest in equity, debt and gold. However, most of the popular hybrid schemes invest in equity and debt assets.

Different types of hybrid funds follow different asset allocation strategies. Remember to have your objectives clear before you invest.",Type of Mutual Funds
What are the various types of mutual funds?,"Equity or Growth Funds
These invest predominantly in equities i.e. shares of companies
The primary objective is wealth creation or capital appreciation.
They have the potential to generate higher return and are best for long term investments.
Examples would be
“Large Cap” funds which invest predominantly in companies that run large established business
“Mid Cap funds” which invest in mid-sized companies. funds which invest in mid-sized companies.
“Small Cap” funds that invest in small sized companies
“""Multi Cap"" funds” funds that invest in a mix of large, mid and small sized companies.
“Sector” funds that invest in companies that are related to one type of business. For e.g. Technology funds that invest only in technology companies
“Thematic” funds that invest in a common theme. For e.g. Infrastructure funds that invest in companies that will benefit from the growth in the infrastructure segment
Tax-Saving Funds
Income or Bond or Fixed Income Funds
These invest in Fixed Income Securities, like Government Securities or Bonds, Commercial Papers and Debentures, Bank Certificates of Deposits and Money Market instruments like Treasury Bills, Commercial Paper, etc.
These are relatively safer investments and are suitable for Income Generation.
Examples would be Liquid Funds, Short Term, Floating Rate, Corporate Debt, Dynamic Bond, Gilt Funds, etc.
Hybrid Funds
These invest in both Equities and Fixed Income, thus offering the best of both, Growth Potential as well as Income Generation.
Examples would be Aggressive Balanced Funds, Conservative Balanced Funds, Pension Plans, Child Plans and Monthly Income Plans, etc.",Type of Mutual Funds
Why continue investing through SIPs in a volatile market?,"When the markets turn volatile many investors start doubting their investment decisions and think of stopping their SIPs or withdrawing their investments. It’s natural to get worried when you see your investments in red during a volatile market. But it would be wise to stay put with your SIPs especially during a falling market because with the same amount of monthly investments you will end up buying more units. We all love to bargain shopping be it during an online sale or simply at the sabzi shop. Isn’t it? Then why not for our Mutual Fund investments when prices are falling?

The market is more unpredictable than even our weather forecast apps. You can never time yourself perfectly to invest a lumpsum amount when the market falls. What if the market falls further after you’ve invested? Similarly, you cannot time yourself perfectly to sell at a market high because the market may go up further after you’ve sold. If you try to catch the market, you will be grossly disappointed, and your returns can be affected due to wrong timing. Hence it is better to invest regularly through highs and lows of the market by investing through a SIP with a clear focus on your goals. You need not worry about market volatility since the cost of your investments will average out over a period. ",More about Mutual Fund
Does long term mean less risk?,"Investments in Mutual Funds require the appropriate time horizon. Having the right time horizon, not only provides a better chance of getting expected, investment returns, but also lowers the risk in the investment.

Now what is this “risk” we are talking about? In simple terms, it is volatility of investment performance, as well as chances of eroding investment capital. By staying invested over the long term, some years of low/negative returns and some years of impressive returns will make the average returns quite reasonable. Therefore, the investor can ‘average out every year’s widely fluctuating returns’ to get a more stable long term return.

The recommended time horizon, differs for every asset class as well as Mutual Fund category. Please consult a financial expert and read the scheme-related documents before making an investment decision.",More about Mutual Fund
What is the risk of investing in Mutual Funds?,"We have all heard: “Mutual Fund investments are subject to market risks.” Ever wondered what are these risks?

The image on the left talks about the various types of risks.

Not all risks impact all the fund schemes. The Scheme Information Document (SID) helps understand which risks apply to your selected scheme.

So how does the fund management team manage these risks?

It all depends on what type of investments the Mutual Fund has invested in. Certain securities are more sensitive to certain risks and some are exposed to some other.

Professional help, diversification and SEBI’s regulations help mitigate risks in Mutual Funds.

Finally, and the most important question that many investors have asked: Can a Mutual Fund company run away with my money? This is just not possible given the structure of Mutual Funds as well as the strong regulations.",More about Mutual Fund
How do Mutual Funds help manage risk?,"Risks appear in many forms. For example, if you own a share of a company, there is a Price Risk or a Market Risk or a Company Specific Risk. The share of just that company may dip or even crash due to any of the above reasons or even a combination of these reasons.

However, in a Mutual Fund, a typical portfolio holds many securities, thus offering “diversification”. In fact, diversification is one of the biggest benefits of investing in a Mutual Fund. It ensures that the dip in price of one or even a few securities does not affect portfolio performance alarmingly.

Another important risk to bear in mind is Liquidity Risk. What is liquidity? It is the ease in converting an asset into cash. Suppose an investor has an investment that is locked in for say 10 years, and she requires money in the 3rd year. This presents a typical liquidity problem. Her priority at this point is access to cash and not returns. Mutual Funds by regulation and structure, offer tremendous liquidity. Portfolios are designed to offer an investor, ease of investing and redemption.",More about Mutual Fund
Understand Risk in Debt Mutual Funds,"You’ve lent 5 lakhs to your friend who owns a start-up @8% interest (higher than current bank rate of 7%). Even though you’ve known him for years, you still run the risk that he may not return your money on time or may fail to pay back. Also, the bank rate may rise to 8.5% while you are stuck with 8%.

Likewise, Debt Funds invests your money in an interest-bearing securities like bonds and money market instruments. These securities promise to make regular interest payments to these funds. Hence Debt Funds are prone to three major risks like you when you lend money to friends.

Firstly, since these funds invest in interest-bearing securities, their NAV fluctuate with changing interest rates (interest rate risk). Prices of these funds fall when interest rates rise and vice-versa.
Secondly, these funds are subject to credit risk i.e. the risk of not receiving the regular payments from the underlying securities (e.g. bonds) they have invested in.
In the worst-case scenario, these funds can face default risk where the bond issuer fails to make the promised payment. When a bond in the underlying portfolio of a Debt Funds defaults in its payments, this impacts the interest income component of the fund thereby adversely affecting your total return from the fund.",More about Mutual Fund
How safe are Direct Mutual Fund platforms to invest in?,"There are many fintech companies that offer Direct Mutual Fund investment platforms either for free or for a fee. Most of these platforms are registered with SEBI, thus well-regulated and governed by security and privacy guidelines mandated by SEBI. Today even Fortune 500 companies can get hacked and similarly so can Mutual Fund platforms. However, it is highly unlikely.

Since most of the Direct platforms are currently owned by startups which haven’t been around for long, there may be a possibility that some of them close down or get acquired by bigger entities. But you shouldn’t worry about your investments made through these registered platforms even if they stop existing in the future because the money invested by you goes into the Mutual Fund’s account and the Fund has a SEBI recognized Registrar to keep an account of your investments .

You can always approach the fund house to access your investments. Choose a Direct Platform if you like its user experience, fees, the services it offers, and if the founding team inspires confidence. Don’t worry about its future and your investments made through them. They will always remain safe with the fund houses.",More about Mutual Fund
What costs does one incur while redeeming Mutual Fund units?,"Open-ended Mutual Funds allow investors to redeem their units after certain period at no cost. If an investor wishes to redeem his/her units before this stipulated period, an exit load is levied. Mutual funds charge exit load if investors sell their investments before having completed a specified time in the fund. This is meant to discourage investors with short-term goals from investing into funds that require long-term holding period. Liquid funds usually don’t have an exit load.

Exit loads are charged as a percentage of the NAV if units are redeemed before a given time as mentioned in the Scheme Information Document. Say, a scheme has 1% exit load if investment is redeemed before one year. If the NAV of the scheme is INR 100 and you redeem your holding before a year, you will receive only INR 99 per unit of your holding as 1% will be deducted by the fund house for premature redemption.

You’ll also incur capital gains tax depending on the kind of investments you’ve made and for how long did you hold the investment i.e Short-term or Long-term capital gains tax. Equity-oriented fun transactions are also subject to STT (Securities Transaction Tax). Every time you buy or sell units from these funds, you pay STT that adds up to the cost of your transaction.",More about Mutual Fund
How to start investing in Mutual Fund schemes?,"Investing in Mutual Funds has now become so easy and simple that one can think of investing in any number of funds without much additional documentation. First-time Mutual Fund investors need to complete their KYC which is a one-time process. You can either approach a distributor or investment advisor to help you complete the KYC verification or you could do e-KYC online. KYC is like a key to the world of Mutual Funds. Once you’ve completed your KYC, you can choose to invest in any fund without going through further verification for each investment.

Once you are ready to invest after KYC verification, you can choose to invest with the help of a mutual fund distributor, registered investment advisor, stock market broker, bank or any other financial intermediary. But if you wish to invest on your own, you can either visit the nearest office of the fund house or visit their website to make an online investment or through any online platform.  

The choice between whether to invest directly or invest through a distributor is an individual one. If you are someone who likes to manage his/her investments on your own, you can surely invest online either through the fund’s website or through any online platform.

"Diversify risk, for potential rewards","Risks could be controlled. And Mutual Funds can be rewarding!

When we say “RISK” in investments, a few questions immediately arise in the mind of the investor… “Is my money safe?”  ”How much return will I get?” “Will I get my money back when I want it?”… While, all these are very valid questions, let’s look at them from three angles to understand Mutual Funds better

Professional Fund Management - Mutual funds are managed by professional fund managers and as an investor, you benefit from their research and expertise. While this may not completely eliminate risk, it certainly lowers it.

Diversification – Mutual Funds invest in a basket of securities. Diversification helps in minimizing the risk from a specific security’s under-performance.

Select a Scheme In Line With Your Investment Objective - If the time horizon of the investment is in sync with the fund selected, you protect yourself from very short term fluctuations. For example, if you have invested in an Equity Fund, you may be affected by short term fluctuations, but over a longer term, you would be more likely to get the long term returns associated with equities.

Most people believe that Mutual Funds are risky possibly because of the standard disclaimer they come across in the Mutual Fund advertisements. It’s important to remember that the stringent regulations that ensure investor protection, professional fund management and diversification mitigate it to a large extent.",More about Mutual Fund
Why is nomination important in Mutual Funds and what is the process for it?,"You may have many goals and dreams in life. You invest your hard-earned money to fulfil those dreams and aspirations. You may also invest to help your loved ones achieve their dreams—both during your life and in your absence.

Everyone has certain goals in life, some dreams to achieve. Every goal also needs some planning and not to forget, finance. One invests their hard-earned money to fulfil those dreams and aspirations, their own as well as their near and dear ones.

Life can be full of surprises. One would expect that after his/her demise, logically, you’re their investments would pass on automatically to their partner, or children. But in real life, it may not be an easy or seamless process. Let’s take the example of Rajiv Gupta to understand why.

Rajiv Gupta had created four different portfolios, one for his goals, one for his wife’s financial security, and the remaining to fund his children’s education. His Mutual Fund SIPs were also planned accordingly.

Luckily, Rajiv Gupta was wise enough to assign a nominee to each of his portfolios. With one simple step, i.e. nomination, Rajiv ensured that the portfolios will be transferred to the rightful nominee and his purpose is fulfilled in case of any eventuality.

Mutual Funds Nominations

Nomination is a simpler and inexpensive way to make things easy for one’s near and dear ones to claim the money in their mutual fund folio, demat account or bank account expeditiously, through minimal paper after their death.

A nomination in respect of the Units does not create an interest in the property after the death of the Unit holder. The rights in the Units will vest in the nominee(s) only upon the death of all Unit Holders. It may be noted that a nominee may not necessarily acquire any title or beneficial interest in the property by virtue of this nomination. The nominee(s) shall receive the Units only as an agent and trustee for the legal heirs or legatees as the case may be.

Is Nomination mandatory for Mutual Funds?

Nomination is mandatory for MF investors. With effect from October 1, 2022, new investors subscribing to Mutual Fund units would have to compulsorily assign a nominee or fill a declaration form to opt out of nomination. Existing investors too would have to either assign a nominee in their older investments or opt out of nomination by March 31, 2023. This is applicable irrespective of whether the investment is held individually or jointly. 

How to add nominees to Mutual Funds investments?

You can add or update the nominees in your Mutual Fund holding by submitting a physical request at the nearest AMC/RTA branch. Alternatively, it can also be done online on the AMC/RTA website or on mfcentral.com. Login to your account and choose the folio under which you want to add/update nominees. Fill in the nominee details like name and address along with the percentage of ownership each nominee will get. If no percentage is specified, each nominee will be eligible for an equal percentage. You will then receive an OTP as part of the two-factor authentication to verify the nominee updation request. Alternatively, the digital form can be signed using the e-Sign facility.

If you are not comfortable online, you can visit the nearest branch or Investor Service Center, of the Fund House to add/update nominee details in your folio. All you need to do is submit a written application or fill up the relevant section of the Common Application Form. You will need to specify the account/folio where you need to add/update nominees and the names of the nominees. In case of more than one nominee in an account/folio, you need to specify the percentage allocation of your investments between all the nominees. Also, in case of joint holding, all the unit holders will have to sign the form with their wet signatures.

Last words

Remember, if an investor doesn’t specify a nominee in his/her account or choose to opt out of nomination, the investments can only be claimed by the legal heir(s) of the investor after proving their legal heirship. This, however, can be a long-run process. Hence, it is advisable to have nominee/s in all your mutual fund investments to enable a smooth transfer of assets in case of an unfortunate event.

So get all your Mutual Fund investment accounts updated with Nominee details and save your family from the hassle of proving their legal heirship to claim your investments in case of an unfortunate event.",More about Mutual Fund

In Mutual Funds too, the starting point must be- What are your requirements?

It begins with your financial goals and risk appetite.

You’ve got to identify your financial goals, first. Some Mutual Fund schemes are suitable for short term requirements or goals, whereas some might be better for long term goals.

Next comes your risk appetite. Different people would have different risk appetite. Even husband and wife may have joint finances but different risk profiles. Some are comfortable with high risk products, whereas some are just not.

How to deal with rumours while investing?,"How often have you come across people you know who have lost money in the stock market because they couldn’t guess where the market would go next moment or who made money because they knew where the market was headed next? Even the best market analysts can’t predict with absolute precision how the market will move the very next moment because financial markets are driven by sentiments and market sentiments are driven by market news. 

An investor today has easy access to market news that may be factually correct or could be a rumour or mere speculation. While investment decisions based on factually correct news may yield positive results, investment decisions based on rumours or speculations can cause loss to investors. 

According to Behavioural Finance Theory, investors are irrational by nature i.e their investment behaviour is not backed by thorough research and analysis but rather influenced by various cognitive and emotional biases including herd mentality. Hence, any incorrect market information can fuel panic amongst investors leading to huge erosion of investor wealth.

Then how can an investor hold himself steady when the market is flooded with all kinds of news ranging from verified ones to rumours? This is where Mutual Fund investments can come to the rescue of millions of small investors who lack the capability and resources to carry out extensive research and analysis. Investing in mutual funds helps circumvent all the above problems as professional fund managers take care of the investment decisions on your behalf. Also, mutual fund investments held over a long period of time help you tide over short-term fluctuations caused by market volatility that is many times fueled by market rumours.

Fund managers have a team of research analysts who carry out extensive research based on all public information to evaluate each security before taking a decision to buy, hold or sell it.  You can always reach out to your SEBI registered financial advisor or mutual fund distributor for guidance in case you come across some market news regarding any security in the fund’s portfolio or about the fund that sounds worrisome.",More about Mutual Fund
If Mutual Funds diversify risk then why are they considered risky?,"Mutual Funds invest in securities, be it equity or debt, whose values fluctuate along with market movement. This makes them risky because NAV of the fund depends on the individual security values held in the fund’s portfolio. But since mutual funds invest in securities across different sectors, they diversify this market risk. Since a fund invests in many securities, the risk that all of them will go down in value on any day is reduced. Thus, it is true that mutual funds diversify risk, but they don’t eliminate it. The diversification followed by a fund manager reduces the market risk of the fund to the extent of diversification. The more diversified a fund is, the less risky it is. 

Concentrated funds like thematic or sector funds are riskier than multi-cap funds will impact all the companies of the affected sector in some way or the other while in a multi-cap fund, the diversification across sector and capitalization works like an airbag during a car accident, reducing the impact of the unfavourable condition on the fund’s NAV.

When you invest in Mutual Funds, look at the degree of diversification in the fund’s sector allocation. Depending on your risk-taking ability, choose a fund with the right kind of diversification that’ll suit you.

Why should one not be bothered by volatility in mutual funds?,"During a long drive, do you worry about your speed or the destination and how to get there? Obviously, you don’t count the bumps but focus on reaching your destination safely in time. The same goes with Mutual Funds. You shouldn’t worry about the daily NAV fluctuations but rather focus on whether it is taking you closer to the financial goal in the time you have set for it.

During the drive, there are numerous times when your speed drops to near zero, but the vehicle picks up speed once you get over the bump and continue your journey. At the end of the trip, what matters is the average speed you clocked to reach your destination. Similarly, a mutual fund can have numerous bumps in the short-term but the longer you stay invested, the impact of these fluctuations decrease and your chances of earning a positive return goes up just like your car’s average speed during a long trip. 

Every economy and hence market go through periods of growth and recession which impact your fund’s return but only in the short-term. Over the long-term, your fund would have gone through several such bouts of ups and downs, but their impact would be muted because it’s the long-term compounded total return that will count at the end of your investment journey.

What is Rupee Cost Averaging?,"When you drive around the city, sometimes you find an empty stretch and speed up to 80kmph while at other times you have to slow down to 20kmph due to traffic or a speed breaker. Finally, you end up clocking an average speed of say 45kmph or 55kmph depending on how often you had to slow down or speed up.

Just like the average speed of your drive through the city, that is neither too fast not too slow, investing in Mutual Funds through SIPs help to navigate the highs and lows of the market with ease. We all know, it is impossible to time the market. Hence an investor can never perfectly time the market highs/lows to buy/sell his or her investments. In such a scenario, a disciplined approach to investing can help investors achieve better control over the impact of market volatility.

When you invest a fixed amount in a mutual fund regularly on pre-defined dates every month over a long period of time, market volatility has less bearing on your investments. This is because you end up buying more units with the same amount when markets fall and buy fewer units with the same amount when markets rise. Thus, the average unit cost of the total units held by you tends to fall over time even if the market moves either way during this period. This is the essence of rupee cost averaging in SIPs.

If you continue with your SIP investments over a long period of time like five years or even longer, if the market has gained, the average cost of units tends to be lower than the prevailing NAV.

SIPs make rupee cost averaging benefits possible apart from offering the power of compounding. Power of compounding becomes more effective over a longer holding period since your investments get more time to multiply further and help in building wealth without pinching your wallet too much.

Have Mutual Funds been around for a long time?,"Collective and pooled investments have existed in various traditional formats across the world for some time. Mutual Fund as we know it came into existence in 1924, with the creation of Massachusetts Investors Trust.

Impressive growth in assets under management as more investors embraced Mutual Funds.
Stricter regulation that ensured investor protection and proper supervision of the Fund Management industry.
Introduction of more innovative products that suited the needs of different customers; from long-term retirement planning to short-term cash management.
Mutual Funds have been in existence in India since the Unit Trust of India (UTI) was established in 1963. UTI was set up by the Government of India and the Reserve Bank of India. Unit Scheme 64, launched in 1964 was the first Mutual Fund scheme.

In 1987, other public sector banks and institutions were permitted to launch Mutual Funds. In 1993, following a wave of liberalization, the private sector and foreign sponsors were allowed to launch Mutual Funds.

This ensured that the Mutual Fund Industry rapidly acquired size, expertise, and reach. As of 31st March 2022, Mutual Funds in India managed assets exceeding 37.7 lakh crore.

Why invest in gold mutual funds when we can invest in gold ETF?,"A Gold ETF is an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that aims to track the domestic physical gold price. They are passive investment instruments that are based on gold prices and invest in gold bullion. In India, Gold is usually held in ornament form, which has a certain making and wastage component (usually more than 10% of bill value). This is eliminated when investing in a Gold Fund.

Buying gold ETFs means you are purchasing gold in an electronic form. You can buy and sell gold ETFs just as you would trade in stocks. When you actually redeem Gold ETF, you don’t get physical gold but receive the cash equivalent. Trading of gold ETFs takes place through a dematerialized account (Demat) and a broker, which makes it an extremely convenient way of electronically investing in gold.

Because of its direct gold pricing, there is complete transparency on the holdings of a Gold ETF. Further due to its unique structure and creation mechanism, the ETFs have much lower expenses as compared to physical gold investments.",More about Mutual Fund
Why invest through Mutual Funds & not directly in stocks or bonds?,"Yes, it is “through” Mutual Funds and not “in” Mutual Funds. What is the difference?

You may indulge in buying and selling stocks and bonds once in a while, but taking help from Mutual Funds to manage your investments may be a much better idea.

When you invest through Mutual Funds, you invest in stocks, bonds or other investments indirectly with the help of professional managers. Instead of doing the tasks yourself, you pay a small fee and avail the services of a fund management company. These services include not just research, selection and buying-selling of various investments, for which a fund manager is well qualified, but also the accounting and administrative activities related to the task of investing, which many may not like to do themselves.",More about Mutual Fund
Are there particular funds that help create wealth over the long term?,"What is wealth? What purpose does it serve?

Many answer these questions as “living a life of one’s dreams”, or “not having to worry about money”, or “having financial freedom”. Being wealthy means having enough money to spend for one’s responsibilities and dreams.

However, for all the long term expenses, one must never forget one major factor – “Inflation”. As the name suggests, inflation is a phenomena that inflates the cost that you will incur to fulfil your life goal when the time arrives to fulfil it.  

Diversified equity funds offer the opportunity to create wealth over the long term at reasonable levels of risk. The risk associated with equities gets controlled with equity Mutual Funds due to three factors

Won’t I need a large amount to invest in Mutual Funds?,"People think that Mutual Funds are elite investments made only for the wealthy. The fact is: one does not need large sum to invest in Mutual Funds, you can start with a sum as low as ₹ 500, or 5000 depending on the kind of fund you choose.

Why keep the minimum amounts as low as these?

The economies of scale can be understood easily if we look at travelling by an airplane. The plane would cost a lot of money and, of course, not everybody owns a plane! However, we can afford air travel simply because all the costs are divided among all the passengers using the services at various different points of time.

Similarly, a person may not have enough money to create a diversified portfolio through investment in a very large number of investment avenues, one may not have enough money required to conduct or purchase research on investments. However, the economies of scale allow small investors to get multiple benefits through Mutual Funds.

Can NRIs invest in Mutual Funds in India?,"Yes, Non Resident Indians (NRI) and Persons of Indian Origin (PIO) can invest in Indian Mutual Funds on a full repatriation as well as non-repatriation basis.

It should however be noted that a few countries such as US and Canada have restricted investments by NRIs in Mutual Funds without relevant disclosures. NRIs from these countries, thus need to check once with their financial expert on the feasibility of investing in Indian funds before actually investing.

NRIs are provided most of the benefits and conveniences of resident Indian investors while investing. They can invest through SIPs, they can switch as per their convenience, they can opt for growth or dividend options and can repatriate the redemption proceeds whenever they want to.

Once the redemption is complete, funds are transferred to the designated bank account of the investor, within 3 business days after the redemption was lodged.

However two issues need to be kept in mind. One, there may be an exit load period in certain schemes. In such cases, redemptions before a certain specified period, say 3 months, may attract a nominal load like 0.5% of Asset Value. Fund Managers impose such loads to deter short term investors.

People consider Mutual Funds as just another investment avenue. Is it really the case? Is a Mutual Fund just another investment avenue like a fixed deposit, debenture or shares of companies?

A Mutual Fund is not an investment avenue, but a vehicle to access various investment avenues.

Think of it this way. When you go to a restaurant, you have a choice to order a la carte or buffet/thali or a full meal.

Get full transparency: Maximum transparency, clear disclosures, and timely statements of accounts are all that a small or first time investor looks out for.
Professionally managed: You can build a diversified portfolio that is professionally managed by Fund Managers, who back their decisions with thorough research.
Every investor is equal: A Mutual Fund gives the same investment performance to an investor who has invested ₹500 or one who has invested ₹5 crore. Thus, it has every investor’s interests in mind – small or big.
Liquidity: Unlike investment options like real estate, it is very easy to redeem Mutual Fund investments when in need. You can redeem the MFs with the Fund house directly or sell in the secondary market.
Every investment comes with its risk. Mutual Funds too involve investment risks like trading volumes, liquidity risk, etc. But they also offer a wide array of benefits to small investors.

There are several ways to increase investments amounts as you go. In a mutual fund scheme, you can always make additional purchases in the same fund/account. In many fund houses, this can be for amounts as low as ₹ 100 or money can be transferred or switched in from other schemes. You can start a Systematic Investment Plan (SIP), which enables a regular investment into a scheme, much like a bank recurring deposit.

What returns can I expect with only ₹ 500?,"Whether one invests ₹ 500 or ₹ 5 crores, the returns are the same. Confused?

Not if you consider the returns on a percentage basis. For example, if a scheme has returns of 12% per annum, then an investment of ₹ 500 would grow to ₹ 627.20 in two years. An investment of ₹ 100,000 in the same scheme would be ₹ 1,25,440 during the same period. While the rate of appreciation is the same in both cases, only the final amounts differ because of difference in initial investments.

We need to bear two things in mind here. Returns in percentage terms is the same for any amount invested. However, a larger amount invested at the start would result in larger absolute gains.

How should I choose whether to go for SIP or Lumpsum?,"Invest in SIP or a one-time investment (lumpsum)? Choosing one depends on your familiarity with Mutual Funds, the fund you want to invest in and your goal.

Like, if you want to save from your monthly income and put it in an option where you can grow your money significantly so that in the long run it’ll be sufficient to fund your child’s higher education, SIP is the answer. Seek help from a financial expert if needed.

If you have surplus cash now, like - bonus, proceeds from property sale or retirement corpus, but unsure how to use it, go for lumpsum investment in a debt or liquid fund. SIPs are advisable for investing in equity-oriented schemes while lumpsums are better suited for debt funds. If you are new to investing in Mutual Funds, SIPs are meant for you. SIPs need sufficiently long-time horizons to prove beneficial. You may invest in lumpsum if the market has been following an upward trend and you think it’ll continue for long.

What is the co-relation between risk and return?,"In Mutual Funds, one often hears, ‘more the risk, more the return’. Is there truth in this?

If ‘risk’ is measured as either, probability of loss of capital or as swings and fluctuations in investment value, then asset classes like equity are undoubtedly the riskiest, and money in a savings bank account or in a government bond is of course least risky.

In the Mutual Fund universe, a liquid fund is least risky and an equity fund is most risky.

So, the only reason to invest in equity would be an expectation of higher reward. However, higher returns come to those who invest in equity after careful study and adopting a patient, long term time horizon. In fact, risk in equity can be mitigated by adopting diversification as well having a longer term time horizon.

Every category of mutual fund schemes have different types of risks – credit risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk, market/price risk, business risk, event risk, regulatory risk, etc. The knowledge of financial experts like your mutual fund distributor / investment advisor and the fund manager, along with diversification, can help mitigate them.",Mutual Fund Returns
Why don't Mutual Funds give a fixed rate of return like a saving account or FD?,"The returns in a Mutual Fund portfolio are a function of many things, like the avenues one has invested in, the way various markets move, the ability of the fund management team, and the investment period.

Since many of these factors are uncertain, the returns cannot be guaranteed, unlike a fixed deposit where these factors are absent, at least to some extent.

With a fixed deposit – the returns are FIXED only for a FIXED period. These returns and the period, both are decided by the issuer company and not by the depositor. Hence, if one wants to invest money for six years and a deposit is available for five years, the returns are known only for the first five years, but not for the entire six-year period. Thus, the investment returns are known only in case of guaranteed return products, where the product maturity and investor’s time horizon are matching perfectly.

In all other cases, the investment returns are unknown over the investor’s investment horizon.",Mutual Fund Returns
Can Mutual Funds help create wealth?,"Business and commerce allows us to create wealth by investing our money with those who are on the path to creating wealth. We can be investors in businesses of entrepreneurs, by investing in stocks of various companies. As the entrepreneurs and the managers run their businesses efficiently and profitably, the shareholders get the benefits. In this regard, Mutual Fund are a great way to build wealth.

But how do we know which stocks to buy, and when?

That is where taking professional help counts. They also take the advantage of a large corpus to explore more opportunities simultaneously. Like a balanced diet – we all need proteins, vitamins, carbohydrates, etc. Eating only one type results in some nutrient deficiency. Similarly, in a diversified equity fund you’re exposed to different segments of the economy, and also protected from the potential downside.

How should one compare the performance of any two schemes,"When you want to buy a car, how do you shortlist the models? Do you first pick up the latest models or decide the type of car? If you are still unsure, you visit a dealer and the first question you are asked is what type of car are you looking for e.g SUV, hatchback, sedan? 

The same goes with the performance comparison of Mutual Fund schemes. You can’t compare performance of schemes belonging to different categories. Schemes from the same category having similar investment objective, asset allocation, and same benchmark index must be compared. Just like you can’t compare an SUV with a sedan because of the way both are designed to suit different needs, schemes designed for different investment objectives may be carrying different risk levels. But when you compare two schemes following the same benchmark it is like comparing the performance of two cars designed with the same engine system. It is fine to compare two bluechip funds or two small cap funds, but you shouldn’t compare the performance of a bluechip fund to that of a small cap fund even if both are equity schemes. Also, within the same category, you should compare performance over the same period just like you shouldn’t compare the mileage of a car running in a city versus that on a highway.

What kind of returns should one expect from Mutual Funds?,"Imagine asking: At what speed do vehicles run?

Can you generalize the answer for the whole category? Different vehicles run at different speeds – even within one category, e.g. cars, while a car made for city roads may run at a certain maximum speed, the one made for racing can run much faster.

There is not one product called Mutual Fund, there are many types of different Mutual Funds. The investment returns from the different categories could vary and then there are certain fund categories that exhibit higher level of uncertainty in performance.

If the fund invests in a market where prices fluctuate a lot, the Net Asset Value (NAV) of the fund is likely to witness huge fluctuations (e.g. growth funds investing in equity market); however, if it invests in a market where prices do not fluctuate much, the Net Asset Value (NAV) of the fund would be quite stable (e.g. liquid funds investing in money market). In other terms, a liquid fund would exhibit far lower uncertainty in comparison to an equity fund.

An investor would be advised to focus on the characteristic nature of the fund and match the same with one’s own requirements.",Mutual Fund Returns
Why do Debt Funds offer lower returns as compared to Equity Mutual Funds?,"Returns from Mutual Funds depend on the kind of investment it makes, and the risks associated with these investments. The taste of a cake differs from that of a samosa because both are made up of different ingredients and are prepared differently. Similarly, equity mutual funds and Fixed Income Funds offer different kinds of returns because of the kind of securities that make up their portfolio and the way these securities generate their returns.

Fixed income funds invest in interest paying securities like bonds, debentures and money market instruments. These securities promise to pay a fixed interest at regular intervals to these Mutual Funds. The rate is closely linked to the prevailing lending rates in the market. Since the issuers of these securities may fail to fulfill their promise, they promise to pay higher periodic interest than current lending rates as a compensation for the risk in such investments. A well-established corporate is likely to offer lower interest (lower risk premium) on its bonds as compared to a rookie company because its bonds carry a higher credit rating than the newer firm.

Returns from an investment are directly linked to the risk involved. Usually debt securities are considered less risky than equities. Thus, lower risk investments like fixed income funds will offer lower returns unlike equity funds",Mutual Fund Returns
How can one track a Mutual Fund performance?,"In this digital and information age, it has become relatively easy to keep track of investment and portfolio performance. While financial experts like mutual fund distributors or investment advisors are irreplaceable partners in your financial journey, it is best for investors to have a little knowledge about their own investments. Don’t worry, you don’t have to sit with mind-boggling spread-sheets and graphs.

Anyone who has invested through an advisor or intermediary usually gets updates and review statements that track portfolio and scheme performance. Even in the absence of such statements, there are several websites and mobile apps that keep track of scheme performance. Some such sites can be customized to track a particular portfolio. Popular business papers also regularly review and comment on Mutual Funds.

Additionally, you can track your investments using Fund Fact Sheet. It is a basic one-page document that gives an overview of a Mutual Fund scheme with special emphasis on disclosure of scheme performance and portfolio and is published every month by each Mutual Fund. It is like a report card that indicates the health of the scheme.

The infographic on the left shows you what a Fact Sheet contains.",Mutual Fund Returns
How do I get my returns in Mutual Funds?,"Like other asset classes, Mutual Funds returns are calculated by computing appreciation in the value of your investment over a period as compared to the initial investment made. Net Asset Value of Mutual Fund indicates its price and is used in calculating returns from your Mutual Fund investments. Return over a period is calculated as the difference in sale date NAV and purchase date NAV upon  purchase date NAV and converted to percentage by multiplying the result by 100 . Any net dividend* or other income distribution by the fund during the holding period is also added to the capital appreciation while computing total returns.

Capital appreciation in Mutual Funds is reflected by increase in NAV over time. This happens because NAV of a fund is derived from stock prices of companies included in the portfolio of the fund, and the prices fluctuate every day. Change in NAV of a fund over time contributes to the capital appreciation or loss in your holding. View the return performance of your investments in the account statement provided to you by the fund house. This statement captures both your transactions and the return on your investments.

Note: *NAV of a Fund falls to the extent of dividend payout and statutory levy, if any.",Mutual Fund Returns
Are there funds that need me to stay invested for a stipulated time?,"One of the biggest advantages in a Mutual Fund scheme is Liquidity, i.e. ease of converting investment into cash.

Equity Linked Savings Schemes (ELSS), which offer tax benefits under Sec 80C, are required by regulation to ‘lock-in’ units for a period of 3 years, after which, they are free to be redeemed.

There is another category of schemes popularly called as “Fixed Maturity Plans” (FMP’s) where investors need to stay invested for a stipulated period which is pre-defined in the offer document of the scheme. These schemes have an investment duration of anywhere between three months to a few years.

A few open end schemes may however, specify an exit load period. For instance, a scheme may specify that units redeemed with 6 months would attract an exit load of 0.50% at applicable NAV.

One should bear in mind that while there be may some rules and regulations on the minimum time horizon. So, it is best to take the advice of a financial expert to know the appropriate or ideal time horizons for every type of scheme.",Mutual Fund Returns
How soon can I withdraw my money from Mutual Funds?,"Mutual Funds are one of the most liquid assets, i.e. it is one of the easiest to convert into cash. In order to redeem funds through offline mode, the unit holder needs to submit a signed Redemption Request form to the AMC's or the Registrar’s designated office. The form requires details like unit holder’s name, folio number, scheme name, and number of units to redeem. The proceeds from the redemption will be credited to the registered bank account of the first named unit holder.

Are there penalties if I choose to withdraw earlier?,"Every open ended scheme offers liquidity with almost complete freedom, i.e. no restriction on time or amount of redemption. However, a few schemes may specify an Exit Load.

For example, a scheme specifies an exit load of 1%, if redeemed within 1 year. What it means is that, if an investor has invested on April 1, 2016, any redemption done on or before March 31, 2017 would attract a penalty of 1% on the NAV. If an investor redeems on February 1, 2017 with the NAV at ₹ 200, then ₹ 2 would be deducted and only ₹ 198 per unit would be returned to investor.

Mutual Fund regulations clearly define the roles and responsibilities of Asset Management Companies (AMC) and Custodians. It’s vital to remember that every investor has to complete an effective KYC process before investing. Therefore, only bonafide investors with a valid PAN card can invest in Mutual Fund schemes. Such investors also provide bank details so that all redemption proceeds are directly credited to an investors own account.

SEBI also ensures that all AMCs are supervised by a board of trustees, some of whom, have to necessarily be independent individuals. These trustees ensure one more level of safeguards and compliance.

When can I withdraw my investment?,"An investment in an open end scheme can be redeemed at any time. Unless it is an investment in an Equity Linked Savings Scheme (ELSS), wherein there is a lock-in of 3 years from date of investment, there are no restrictions on investment redemption.

Investors need to keep in mind any applicable exit load on their investment. Exit loads are charges deducted at the time of redemption, only if applicable. AMCs usually impose an exit load to deter short term or speculative investors from entering a scheme.

Closed end schemes do not offer this, as all units are automatically redeemed on the date of maturity. However, units of closed end schemes are listed at a recognised stock exchange, and investors can sell their units to others only through the exchange.

Is there an advantage in investing in funds with an exit load?,"Let’s consider a Balanced Fund, which aims to provide growth and capital appreciation from the equity portion, and income and stability from the debt portion. This scheme still carries considerable risk, as the portion of equity could be as high as 60%. This is recommended only for investors with a healthy risk appetite and long term time horizon.

The fund management team of such a scheme would ideally want only long term investors who share their conviction of staying invested for a long period, of a minimum of 3 years. Thus the fund may impose an exit load of 1% for all redemptions done before 3 years. In such a case, the fund is not impacting liquidity directly, but is discouraging investors from exiting before a period of 3 years.

The advantage for the scheme would stem from the fact that all investors are aligned to a longer time horizon. This would be a comforting factor for the fund manager, enabling him to pick securities with such a thought in mind. In the fund manager’s view such a strategy would enable better fund performance, as there would be no short term investors and redemptions impacting a long term strategy.",withdrawing from Mutual Fund 
How often can I remove my money?,"An investor has no restriction on redeeming money from an open ended scheme. While there may be an exit load in certain cases, which impacts final amount realised, all open end schemes offer liquidity as a great benefit.

Units under lien to a bank or institution cannot be redeemed, unless the lien is removed. Redemptions may be restricted only under extraordinary circumstances, as decided by the Board of Trustees.

Is it Wise for Retirees to Invest in Mutual Funds?,"Retired people usually have their savings and investments locked up in bank FDs, PPFs, gold, real estate, insurance, pension plans etc. Most of these options are difficult to convert to cash immediately. This may lead to undue stress in case of medical or other emergencies. Mutual Funds provide the much-needed liquidity to retirees as they are easy to withdraw and offer better post-tax returns.

Most retired people fear the volatility or fluctuation in returns of Mutual Funds and stay away from them. They should put some part of their retirement corpus in Debt Mutual Funds and go for a Systematic Withdraw Plan (SWP). This will help them earn a regular monthly income from such investments. Debt funds are relatively safer than equity funds as they invest in bonds issued by banks, companies, government bodies and money market instruments (bank CDs, T-bills, Commercial Papers).

SWP in debt funds provides tax efficient returns as compared to bank FDs. Income from FDs/pension plans are taxed at higher effective rates compared to withdrawals under SWP. You can easily stop a SWP or change the withdrawal amount anytime depending on your need unlike in a pension plan. Thus, retirees should include Mutual Funds in their financial plans.",withdrawing from Mutual Fund 
How much of my investment can I withdraw?,"Majority of Mutual Fund schemes are open end schemes, which allow an investor to redeem the entire invested amount without any time restrictions.

However, any dividend declared by these schemes during this period is available as a pay out without restrictions. No other category of schemes can impose such a lock-in. Some may impose an exit-load for premature redemptions, to prevent short term investments from entering a scheme. AMCs may specify minimum amounts that may be submitted.

Who should invest in Debt Funds?,"If someone asked you, who should eat more of proteins or carbohydrates or vitamins, what would be your answer?

Everyone!

Everybody needs to eat all kinds of nutrients, but the proportion of nutrients will vary for each person depending on age and physical requirements. For instance, growing children need more proteins and carbohydrates than adults. They also need sufficient supply of energy-rich carbohydrates. The same principle applies to your investment portfolio too.

Each person needs to have a mix of equity, debt funds, gold, real-estate and other assets in his/her investment portfolio. But the proportion of each asset will vary for each person. Thus, everyone needs to have some exposure to fixed income assets like Debt funds. Senior citizens need to allocate more of their portfolio to Debt funds than youngsters in their 30s. Amongst the youngsters, a conservative investor who is uncomfortable taking high risk should invest more in Debt funds than his peers who may be more comfortable with the volatile nature of equity investing. As a thumb rule, it is recommended to allocate a proportion of your portfolio equal to your age to fixed income assets like Debt funds. New Mutual Fund investors can also start with debt funds.

How do interest rate changes affect my return from Debt Funds?,"Debt Funds invest in fixed income securities like corporate or Government bonds and money market instruments. These securities are interest bearing instruments that pay a fixed interest (coupon rate) to investors at regular intervals and pay the invested amount (principal) at maturity. The prices of these securities are directly affected by interest rate changes. Bond prices and interest rates are inversely proportional.

A bond’s coupon rate is fixed at the time when the bond is first issued at certain price (Face Value). If interest rates fall below the coupon rate, the bond looks more attractive as it carries higher interest than currently available in the market. Hence, demand for such bonds go up, pushing their prices up. If interest rates rise, these bonds look unattractive and their prices fall due to lower demand.

When interest rates rise, prices of fixed income securities fall. This leads to a decline in the NAV of fixed income funds that hold these securities in their portfolio. On the other hand, when interest rates fall, prices of fixed income securities rise, leading to an increase in the NAVs of fixed income funds. Thus, you get a positive return from your fixed income fund investment when interest rates fall and vice-versa.",Debt Fund
Know more about Debt Funds.,"Equity Mutual Funds buy stocks while Debt funds buy debt fund securities like bonds for their portfolio. Securities like bonds aare issued by corporates such as power utilities, banks, housing finance and the Government. They issue bonds with fixed interest rate to raise money from the public (investors) instead of taking a loan for new projects. Bonds are a promise to pay periodic fixed interest to investors who buy them.

When investors buy bonds with a maturity of a few years, they are lending their money to the issuer (say ABC Power Ltd.) for those many years. ABC promises to pay periodic interest to its investors during this time in return for the money they have invested in its bonds (=money lent to ABC). ABC is the borrower like a customer taking a home loan. The investor (your Mutual Fund investing your money) is the lender to ABC just like the bank is a lender to the home loan customer.

What are Debt Funds?,"A debt fund is a Mutual Fund scheme that invests in fixed income instruments, such as Corporate and Government Bonds, corporate debt securities, and money market instruments etc. that offer capital appreciation. Debt funds are also referred to as Fixed Income Funds or Bond Funds.

A few major advantages of investing in debt funds are low cost structure, relatively stable returns, relatively high liquidity and reasonable safety.

Debt funds are ideal for investors who aim for regular income, but are risk-averse. Debt funds are less volatile and, hence, are less risky than equity funds. If you have been saving in traditional fixed income products like Bank Deposits, and looking for steady returns with low volatility, debt Mutual Funds could be a better option, as they help you achieve your financial goals in a more tax efficient manner and therefore earn better returns.

In terms of operation, debt funds are not entirely different from other Mutual Fund schemes. However, in terms of safety of capital, they score higher than equity Mutual Funds.",Debt Fund

Where do Debt Funds invest our money?,"Debt Funds invest the money pooled from investors in bonds issued by banks, PSUs, PFIs (Public Financial Institutions), corporates and the Government. These bonds are usually medium to long-term in nature. When a Mutual Fund invests in such bonds, it earns periodic interest from these bonds which contribute to the fund’s total return over time.

Some Debt Funds also invest in money market instruments like T-bills issued by the Government, Commercial Papers, Certificates of Deposits, Bankers’ Acceptance, Bills of Exchange, etc. which are more short-term in nature. These instruments also promise to make fixed interest payments at regular intervals which contribute to the fund’s overall return over time.

While both bonds and money market instruments promise their investors i.e. your Mutual Fund to make regular interest payments in the future, they may fail to meet these obligations under certain circumstances like financial distress. Hence, while Debt Funds are considered more stable than equity funds, they still carry some risk because these issuers may fail to make timely payments which form a significant portion of the fund’s total return.",Debt Fund
Can Debt Funds provide regular income?,"Debt Funds invest their investors’ money in interest-bearing securities like bonds, corporate deposits, G-secs, money market instruments, etc. These bonds are like certificates that carry an obligation on the part of the bond issuer to pay regular interests (coupons) to the bond investors. Thus, debt funds earn regular interest income from such securities held in their portfolio. The interest earned by a debt fund from its bond portfolio can either be distributed among investors or accrued to the fund i.e. added to the fund assets, leading to an increase in NAV. Thus, unlike equity funds which depend on divided distribution from their portfolio of stocks, debt funds have a regular interest income, from the underlying portfolio, built into their features.

As an investor, you can opt for a dividend payout option if you wish to receive regular income from your debt funds. While the option is named as ‘Dividend Payout’, it distributes the interest income and other capital gains earned from its portfolio at regular intervals. Even though the portfolio of a Debt Fund comprises of interest-paying securities, making its dividend distribution more predictable and regular than that of an Equity Mutual Fund, these dividends are not guaranteed. Dividends are paid only when the fund has a distributable surplus. Talk about distributable surplus and that income will not be regular always.",Debt Fund

Are Debt Funds like Fixed Deposits?,"When you park your money in a bank Fixed Deposit (FD), the bank promises to pay fixed interest in return. Here you’ve lent money to the bank, and the bank is a borrower of your money, owes you a fixed periodic interest. Debt Mutual Funds invest in debt securities like Government bonds, Company bonds, Money market securities. Bonds are issued by corporates like power companies, banks, home finance companies and the Government. These bond issuers promise to pay their investors (those who buy their bonds), a periodic interest in return for their money invested in the bonds.

Bond issuers are like the bank (borrower) in our FD example, borrowing money from investors and promising to pay periodic interest. While you are the investor in a bank FD, Debt Funds  are the investors in these bonds. Just like you earn interest from an FD, Debt Funds earn periodic interests from their bond’s portfolio. Unlike assured interest from FDs, periodic interest payments to fixed income Debt Funds from these bonds can be fixed or variable without any guarantee. When they sell bonds from their portfolio, they get the principal back. When you invest in a Fixed Income Mutual Fund, you indirectly invest in its bond portfolio, spreading the risk across different bond issuers. You benefit from such risk diversification.",Debt Fund
